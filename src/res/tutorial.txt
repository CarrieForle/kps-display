The format textbox allows you to format KPS display with the text of your input. This is typically used to add indicator (e.g., KPS: 7) but you are free to do whatever you want.

This serves as a reference rather than a tutorial. Read the doc online: https://example.com for such purpose.
  %s is the placeholder for KPS.
  %d is %s except it does not use customized KPS.
  %x is %d except it display in hex in lower case.
  %X is %x but in upper case.
  To use `%` literally, use `%%`.

For example, if KPS were 5 and the custom KPS for 5 is `V`:
`KPS: %s` = `KPS: V`
`%s%d`    = `V5`
`%s%%`    = `V%`

If KPS were 12:
`%x` = `b`
`%x` = `B`

You can further customize KPS appearance with flags and width inside the placeholders.
  `-` flag allows you to left align KPS. (By default KPS is right-aligned)
  `0` flag allows you to pad with 0.
  `c` flag is 0 except we use customized padding
  The width is a positive integer controlling the minimum width (number of characters) of KPS.

It works like `printf()` in C programming language.

For example, if KPS were 10 and custom KPS is not specified:
`%11s`  = `         10`
`%011s  = `00000000010`
`%-11s` = `10         `

Note the width of KPS in this case is 2 because `10` is of 2 characters. We specified the minimum width of KPS as 11, so 9 extra space are "padded" to KPS.

Because we don't have custom KPS, %d and %s in this case is the same. If we specified a custom KPS for 10 to `Madeline`:
`%11s`  = `   Madeline`
`%011s  = `000Madeline`
`%-11s` = `Madeline   `

`Madeline` is in place of %s while %d will look the same as the previous example.
