## Getting Start

Unzip the archive and double click on the program (`kps32.exe` for 32-bit; `kps64` for 64-bit) and it should be working out-of-box. Right click and click **Configure** to start configure the program. 

All the configuration can be done inside the program. However you can also do this with a text editor. To do this, copy `default.ini`, rename it and edit it there. You can then load the configuration file, A.K.A **profile**, in the program.
